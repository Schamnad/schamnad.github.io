**Integration of cclib with Avogadro 2**

### A little Introduction
I applied for Google Summer of code in the final semester of my undergraduate studies. During my undergraduate studies I concentrated on the field of Computational Chemistry, where I used Avogadro quite a bit. Avogadro is an advanced molecular editor, used for various research purposes.

I applied for GSOC-2016 under the Open Chemistry organization because I had extensively utilized the applications provided by them and I wanted to give back to the community. The entire summer has been a very fruitful period where I have interacted with my mentors on a daily basis. I have also indicated to them that I wish to continue contributing to the organization
