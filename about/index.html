Hi there,

My name is Sanjeed Schamnad, I am a recent graduate from Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS) - Pilani, Pilani campus. 
I majored in Chemistry and Computer Science. While in college, I primarily worked in the field of computational chemistry. My primary 
area of interest was the DFT studies of Selenium containing compounds.

This website was initially created as part of the requirements of the Google Summer of Code project I undertook in 2016. I worked with 
the Open Chemistry organization on the integration of cclib data parser with Avogadro - 2, a computational chemistry visualization application.

Presently, i.e. as of August 21st, 2016 I am working with the Detail Page - Platform team at the Amazon Development Centre in Bangalore

Do hit me up if you have any interesting to say or discuss.
